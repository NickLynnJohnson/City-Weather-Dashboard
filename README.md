# City-Weather-Dashboard

The City Weather Dashboard is an application that displays the current weather and 5-day forecast for a city that the user searches for. The current weather section showcases the city, date, and weather icon as well the city's temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The 5-day forecast shows more of a snapshot weather display that includes the date, weather icon, temperature, and humidity. The webpage conveniently includes a list of all cities the user searched for and if the user accidently refreshes the page, the application will auto-populate the last city that the user searched for (this is accomplished using local storage).

Real-time weather data was pulled from the Open Weather API and the webpage in general was influenced by: Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Moment.js, and JQuery.
